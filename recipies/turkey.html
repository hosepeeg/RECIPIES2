            <p class="closer">My grandmother and mother passed this recipe on to me. It changes just a little every year, because we've never written it down before. 
                But it is always incredibly juicy and succulent! </p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a turkey roaster with long sheets of aluminum foil that will be long enough 
                    to wrap over the turkey.</li>
                <li>Stir together the parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Rub the herb mixture into the cavity of the 
                    turkey, then stuff with the celery, orange, onion, and carrot. Truss if desired, and place the turkey into the roasting pan. Pour the
                     chicken broth and champagne over the turkey, making sure to get some champagne in the cavity. Bring the aluminum foil over the top of 
                     the turkey, and seal. Try to keep the foil from touching the skin of the turkey breast or legs.</li>
                <li>Bake the turkey in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear. Uncover the turkey,
                     and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 minutes to 1 hour longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest
                      part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of 
                      aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
